# SpotifySDK--UE5
Spotify Web API SDK built with native Unreal Engine wrappers

Note: The current SDK does not provide any logic on creating authentication tokens. This requires an intermediate step with a web-url callback. However there is support on Client Id and Client Secret to get you started with parsing data to a Launch URL.
